# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

Use this section to tell people about which versions of your project are
currently being supported with security updates.

| Version | Supported          |
| ------- | ------------------ |
| 1.0.x   | :white_check_mark: |
| beta   |  :white_check_mark: |
| development   | :x:                |


## Reporting a Vulnerability
Please open a "new issue" under Issues, so that you can create a "bug report". 
Otherwise, if the security bug is "very dangerous", please write a message to contact@invalidlenni.de!

## What happens if my bugreport is rejected?
I will add only 2 labels and close your bugreport.

## What happens if my bugreport is accepted?
I add labels (maximum 4, but mostly 2 - 3) and put it on my ToDo list and on the Known Issues Page (Known Issues Page is coming soon, means not findable / doesn't exist yet)
